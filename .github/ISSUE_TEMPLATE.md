# Reporting an Issue with sparklyr

Please briefly describe your problem and, when relevant, the output you expect.
For general programming questions with `sparklyr`, please ask on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) instead.

If at all possible, please include a [minimal, reproducible
example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example).
The `sparklyr` team will be much more likely to resolve your issue if they are
able to reproduce it themselves locally.

Please delete this preamble after you have read it.
